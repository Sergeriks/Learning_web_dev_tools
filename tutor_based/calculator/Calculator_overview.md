The project here includes a basic calculator app that was made following [Bro Code's tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5kj-YsmWjM).

Some of the minor adjustments that were made to this project in comparison to the original were:
 - instead of adding operators on top of each other, they get replaced by the ones that are being inputted;
 - prevent the user from adding additional commas on top of other commas;
 - autoscroll uppon entering new characters if said characters were to go offscreen;
 - added buttons to allow for easier scrolling to the left and right sides of the display;
 - added a button that allows you to delete other previous characters;
 - minor fixes to program logic when calculating with numbers that include decimals ( this does not apply entirely to multiplication or division).
