The project here includes a basic app the involves the use of a single button which is used to switch between different background colors.

This was made while following along a [tutorial provided by freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=421s).
There are 2 different options for producing different colors. 

Pressing the button while being in the *Simple* tab involves scrolling through previously predefined background colors.

Pressing the button while being in the *Hex* tab will create a background color on the fly with the use of hex code by scrolling through 15 individual values defined within the array. Only 6 of said values will be used to produce a single background color.

Some of the minor adjustments that were made to this project:
 - inclusion of simple transitions when switching between different colors, to avoid rapid color switching;
 - the ability to click on the page logo (*Color Flipper* in this case) to reset the background color (was done to avoid the need to refresh the browser tab);
 - made the CSS file from scratch (used [Codehal's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RroDdybvu5s) as reference guide for it).
