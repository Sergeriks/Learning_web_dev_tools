This project involved the creation of a simple counter. There is an option to increase, decrease or reset the value within said counter.

This was made while following along a [tutorial provided by freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=1825s). There are 2 different options for producing different colors.

The project itself doesn't include any new functions, however for learning purposes I had included several some effects and animations to imitate the feel of games like [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/).
