# Learning Web Development Tools
  This repository contains projects developed using tutorials, along with personal modifications and original work.

  Projects included here may not be completely original and in the cases that they are not, will include a link to the referenced projects and 
are to be included within the matching folders. The folders for the projects will be named as:
 - tutor_based;
 - individual.

  Projects included within the *tutor_based* folder mean that the projects were made following along a tutorial (with minimum adjustments)
while the *individual* folder will include personal projects that may incorporate features inspired by tutorials, with appropriate references provided.
